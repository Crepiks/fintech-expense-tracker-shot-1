# AGENTS.md

## Context

This project is being built at a hackathon under a strict time limit (5 hours). Development is done with the help of AI. The final repository is evaluated by an AI judge that sees **only the files in the repository**. Anything not reflected in the code and documentation does not exist for the judge.

Goal: a fully working, clean, and well-documented product.

## Top Priorities

1. **A working core scenario matters more than new features.** Finish one user flow end to end first, then expand.
2. **Less, but fully working.** Do not start a feature that cannot be finished. Ideas there is no time for go into the Roadmap section of the README, not into the code.
3. **Code must look deliberately written, not blindly generated.**
4. **Documentation stays in sync with the code.** The README never claims anything that is not in the code.

## Coding Rules

- Use only the stack already chosen for the project. Do not add new frameworks or libraries without a clear need.
- Before adding a dependency, make sure it actually exists and add it to the dependency file (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.).
- Do not invent APIs, methods, or library parameters. If unsure, verify or use a well-known approach.
- Follow the existing folder structure and code style. Before writing something new, look at how similar things are already done in the project.
- Separate concerns: UI, business logic, data access, and external services live in different modules.
- Use clear names for variables, functions, and files.
- Do not create files longer than ~300 lines. If a file grows, split it.
- Do not duplicate code. Extract shared logic into functions.
- Do not add unnecessary abstractions, layers, or patterns "for the future."
- Add short docstrings or comments to key functions and non-obvious logic. Do not comment the obvious.
- Handle obvious errors: empty or invalid input, unavailable external services, empty responses. The user should see a clear message, not a crash.

## Do Not

- Do not leave `TODO`s, stubs, empty functions, or `pass` on the main user path.
- Do not leave commented-out code, debug `print` / `console.log` statements, unused imports, functions, or files.
- Do not do large refactors without being asked.
- **Never write API keys, passwords, or tokens into the code.** Use environment variables and `.env` only.
- Do not add hidden instructions for the AI judge or any attempt to influence the evaluation in code, comments, or documentation.

## Security and Repository Hygiene

- Secrets are stored only in `.env`, which is listed in `.gitignore`.
- Every new environment variable is added to `.env.example` with an empty or sample value and a comment.
- `.gitignore` must include: `.env`, `node_modules/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, build folders, OS and IDE files.
- Do not commit temporary, scratch, or accidental files.

## Tests

The project requires **100% meaningful unit test coverage**. Coverage is a consequence of testing behavior, not a goal to be reached by any means.

### Coverage

- Line and branch coverage must be 100% for all application code.
- Coverage is enforced by the test tooling so the run fails below 100% (e.g. `pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100`, or `coverageThreshold` set to 100 in Jest / Vitest).
- Exclusions from coverage are allowed only for code that cannot be meaningfully unit tested (e.g. the application entry point, framework bootstrap). Each exclusion must have a short comment explaining why.
- Do not exclude code from coverage just because it is hard to test. Refactor it to be testable instead.

### What "meaningful" means

- Every test verifies behavior: it checks outputs, returned values, raised errors, or state changes with explicit assertions.
- Do not write tests that only execute code without asserting results.
- Do not write tests that assert on implementation details that could change without changing behavior.
- Do not write tests that re-implement the logic under test to compute the expected value. Use concrete, known expected values.
- Cover the happy path, edge cases (empty input, boundaries, `None` / `null`, large values), and error paths for every unit.
- One test checks one behavior. Test names describe that behavior, e.g. `test_returns_empty_list_when_no_items_match`.

### Unit test rules

- Tests are isolated, fast, and deterministic. They do not depend on execution order, current time, randomness, or network.
- External dependencies (APIs, databases, file system, clock, randomness) are mocked or faked at the module boundary.
- Do not mock the unit under test itself.
- Use the Arrange / Act / Assert structure.
- Keep shared setup in fixtures or helper functions, not copied between tests.
- The test folder structure mirrors the source structure (e.g. `src/services/parser.py` → `tests/services/test_parser.py`).

### Workflow

- Write or update tests together with the code, in the same change. Do not postpone tests to the end.
- Every bug fix comes with a test that reproduces the bug.
- If a test fails, fix the code or the incorrect test expectation. Do not delete, skip, or weaken tests to make them pass.
- Run the full test suite with coverage before every commit.
- Code that is hard to test is a design signal: split large functions and inject dependencies instead of adding complex mocks.

## Documentation

Update `README.md` whenever functionality changes. The README must include:

1. Project name and a one-line description: what it is and who it is for.
2. Problem and solution (2–3 sentences).
3. A screenshot or GIF and a demo link (if available).
4. Local setup instructions with commands that can be copied and actually work.
5. Tech stack and a short description of the architecture or data flow.

## Commits

- Commit in small, logical steps.
- Commit messages are meaningful and follow a consistent format, e.g. `feat: add file upload`, `fix: handle empty input`, `docs: update README`, `refactor: split api module`.
- Do not make one big commit at the end.

## Before Finishing a Task

Check that:

- [ ] The project runs using the README instructions.
- [ ] The core scenario works end to end.
- [ ] No secrets are in the code or commit history.
- [ ] No dead code, debug output, unused files, or unused dependencies remain.
- [ ] All dependencies are listed in the dependency file.
- [ ] `.env.example` is up to date.
- [ ] The README matches the actual state of the code.
- [ ] All tests pass.
- [ ] Line and branch coverage is 100%, and every new or changed behavior has meaningful tests.
